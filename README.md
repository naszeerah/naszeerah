Salam and Hello. Thank you for your interest in my budding GitHub page, where you may find useful resources related to public health and computational social science. 

As an educator, I have some experiences in teaching epidemiologic methods, data visualization (including GIS-based mapping) and public health preparedness to graduate students at UC Berkeley.

As a researcher, I started off as an infectious diseases epidemiologist but have recently transitioned into an "infodemiologist", primarily aiming to dynamics of vaccine confidence and vaccine information in Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia (two of the most popular languages in Southeast Asia). 

For more information about "Projek Infodemik", please visit www.naszeerah.com and/ or my social media accounts listed on the left.
