Salam and Hello.

# üíª I plan to share resources on... <br/>
...anything I find useful in my own journey as a researcher, an educator, a consultant, and a life-long learner. 

As a researcher, I started off as an infectious diseases epidemiologist but have recently transitioned into an "infodemiologist", primarily aiming to dynamics of vaccine confidence and vaccine information in Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia (two of the most popular languages in Southeast Asia). For more information about "Projek Infodemik", please visit www.naszeerah.com and/ or my social media accounts listed on the left. 

As an educator, I have taught Epidemiologic Research Design, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) aka "mapping", Data Cleaning and Manipulation, as well as Data Visualization Tools. Most of my teaching experiences have involved undergraduate- and graduate-level students, both offline and online.

As a consultant, I have delivered trainings and talks on using different platforms for research data management and analysis, such as REDCap and Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

As a life-long learner, I am currently primarily interested in enhancing skills related to social media data -- from scraping to training machine learning models.  

# ü§ù I am seeking support.

# üëèüèΩ If you're new, here's a note for you.
When I first entered this space, it felt like everyone was far ahead. As the first woman in my Malay family to attain education beyond high school, I understand how *intimidating* or *overwhelming* it can be to pick up skills in tech/ data science/ computational social science/ precision public health. But, the truth is no one was born with these skills and even the most experienced are continuously learning. Some have had the privilege to start their learning journey really early. Others, including me, have only gotten the opportunities at later stages of our life. So, if you secretly feel "behind", don't worry: you're not alone.

Thank you for reading this far. If you have any enquiry, please reach me through any of my social media inboxes.
